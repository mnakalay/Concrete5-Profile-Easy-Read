# Concrete5-Profile-Easy-Read
A simple Bookmarklet to make user profiles on concrete5.org easier to read

## Why this bookmarklet
Reading a user's profile on concrete5.org is a bit of a pain in the neck as information is presented mostly as images with extra information only available on hover.

A prospective client looking to assess several developers for instance would have to go to each profile and hover on badges one after another to do so.

That's not productive and frankly it's a pain in the rumpus.

## What it does
This little bookmarklet does 2 things:

  - It modifies the page's styling to make it readable without hovering
  - It adds some print styling to make it easy to print in a readable way
